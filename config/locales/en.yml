 about_us:
   body:                 "Fuel Me Green was started by a group of friends with the aim of making fuel efficient vehicles
                          more affordable. We saw a market disconnect between the environmental and economic benefits of
                          fuel efficient vehicles and stated consumer interest. We hope our website can provide a financial
                          solution to allow more consumers to drive the hybrid/electric vehicle they desire. Ultimately,
                          we hope that Fuel Me Green can play a significant role in helping increase the rate of adoption
                          of Electric or Hybrid vehicles."
